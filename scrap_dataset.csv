"Machine learning programs can perform tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so. It involves computers learning from data provided so that they carry out certain tasks. For simple tasks assigned to computers, it is possible to program algorithms telling the machine how to execute all steps required to solve the problem at hand; on the computer's part, no learning is needed. For more advanced tasks, it can be challenging for a human to manually create the needed algorithms. In practice, it can turn out to be more effective to help the machine develop its own algorithm, rather than having human programmers specify every needed step.",14,32,33,34,1,400,1
"The discipline of machine learning employs various approaches to teach computers to accomplish tasks where no fully satisfactory algorithm is available. In cases where vast numbers of potential answers exist, one approach is to label some of the correct answers as valid. This can then be used as training data for the computer to improve the algorithm(s) it uses to determine correct answers.

"Machine learning and often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on properties learned from the training data, focuses on the of (previously) properties in the data (this is the analysis step of in databases). Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as "" "" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data.",14,32,33,34,1,400,1

"An ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called "" "", which loosely model the in a biological . Each connection, like the in a biological , can transmit information, a ""signal"", from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a , and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called ""edges"". Artificial neurons and edges typically have a that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.",14,32,33,34,1,400,1

"The adjective ""deep"" in deep learning refers to the use of multiple layers in the network. Early work showed that a linear cannot be a universal classifier, but that a network with a nonpolynomial activation function with one hidden layer of unbounded width can. Deep learning is a modern variation that is concerned with an unbounded number of layers of bounded size, which permits practical application and optimized implementation, while retaining theoretical universality under mild conditions. In deep learning the layers are also permitted to be heterogeneous and to deviate widely from biologically informed models, for the sake of efficiency, trainability and understandability.",14,32,33,34,1,400,1

"Alternatively, engineers may look for other types of neural networks with more straightforward and convergent training algorithms. CMAC ( ) is one such kind of neural network. It doesn't require learning rates or randomized initial weights for CMAC. The training process can be guaranteed to converge in one step with a new batch of data, and the computational complexity of the training algorithm is linear with respect to the number of neurons involved.",14,32,33,34,1,400,1
